# HereUS PBC
HereUS allows you to communicate with your friends, access reliable information, manage your data in single place, browse web more securely, and more...

We think people should know how the apps they are using are working. Thus, we open sourced the most!

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the source codes can depend on private repositories. We are open-sourcing everything we can; however, for security reasons, we have to keep some closed-source until we grow enough to be able update them before a possible abuse of open source.

### [HereUS UI 3.2](https://github.com/hereus-pbc/hereus_ui_3_2)

This is the design our softwares have from very start.

### [HereUS Websites](https://github.com/hereus-pbc/serverMainProc)

We wanted to give you transparency on how your data you enter in our web apps are processed.
Also, we wanted to make you able to check by yourself that we don't keep your data on our servers and directly get and send from your network.

### [LAST](https://github.com/hereus-pbc/LAST)

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository is not available at the moment. It will be open-sourced after a great re-write.

We have our all data on super apps. Why shouldn't we able to take a look into how they work?
